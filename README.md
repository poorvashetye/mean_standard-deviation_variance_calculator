# Mean Standard Deviation Variance Calculator

This Python project calculates the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of a 3x3 matrix. It's designed to showcase fundamental concepts in numerical computation using NumPy.

## Features

- **Mean Calculation:** Calculate mean values along rows, columns, and the flattened matrix.
- **Variance and Standard Deviation:** Compute variance and standard deviation for both rows and columns.
- **Max, Min, and Sum:** Provide information about maximum, minimum, and sum of elements along rows, columns, and the entire matrix.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/mean_standard-deviation_variance_calculator.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd mean_standard-deviation_variance_calculator`
3. Run the `main.py` file: `python main.py`
4. View the results in the console.
